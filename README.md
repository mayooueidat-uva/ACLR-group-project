# You're Pulling My Leg: Visualizing a Patient's ACLR Journey
### Description of the project
Our project uses artificial data on patients’ strength, physical function, and psychological readiness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), a surgical procedure used to correct athletes’ anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Children and adolescents may have difficulty understanding their recovery trajectory when presented with out-of-context health data and complex medical jargon; therefore, we created examples of visualisations and descriptions that would enable patients to track their own recovery journey. The report is intended to establish guidelines for reports tailored to individual athletes using real data; it is not intended as a research study. 

### Relevance to our data science careers
While embarking on the project, we learned to communicate data clearly and concisely, challenging ourselves to write for an audience who likely lacked academic understanding of ACLR and experience reading nicher data visualisations. 
The report is relevant to our future careers because it helped us practice bridging the communication gap between us—the people tasked with conducting research with technology—and stakeholders who may not possess our technical or domain knowledge.
