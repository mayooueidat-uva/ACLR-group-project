## Audience

Our dataset largely consists of patients aged 12 to 20, but some patients fall outside the typical age range. Therefore, our working audience includes all patients who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery and can benefit from visual tools to understand their recovery.


## Problem Statement

ACLR patients often confront dense jargon and tables of information and scores that obscure their true progress and drain motivation. We need intuitive, patient-centered visuals, showing each patient’s progress alongside peer ranges and age‑based comparisons, that turn numbers into accessible visual stories and keep young athletes confident in their rehabilitation.

## Analysis

Patients have the right to understand their ACLR recovery without barriers that limit their comprehension.

### Line Plot

Having the patient be able to **picture themselves in the data** is important, as we want for them to understand where they stand in recovery without explicitly knowing miniscule details about medical terminology. Sometimes, seeing yourself as a positive sloping line among a similarly trending population is enough reassurance that recovery is on track.

Below is a line graph that captures a single patient's recovery progress for Flexion LSI. Additionally, it has Flexion LSI data over visits from all the patients in the study, which acts as a comparison point for the patient. The patient can easily view their individual recovery, alongside the overall recovery trend from other patients. The goal is for the graph to be intuitive and understandable without needing complex medical or statistics jargon.

We can prepare similar graphs for our patients with other variables of interest, shown below.

### KDE Plot

Though the line plot is useful for showcasing an individual patient's progress over time, it is not effective for portraying the distribution of data; therefore, we want to use a kernel density estimate plot stratified by visit number. We excluded visits above 4, as most patients had fewer visits. 

Compared to line plots, the KDEplot is less familiar to our target audience, so our graph includes an explanation of what it is supposed to portray. We hope that our visualization will demonstrate that people are *more likely* to have better scores as time passes and reassure patients who fear they will never feel ready to return to sport. Our example below uses ACL-RSI scores, which gauge psychological readiness to return to sport.

### Boxplot

The box plot allows patients to understand their data compared to different demographics. Each box in our example below represents the interquartile range (IQR) of LSI Extension Strength (60°/s) within an age group, while the whiskers show variability and the dots highlight outliers. By stratifying the data, we emphasize that strength recovery can vary with age, which is helpful for setting age-appropriate expectations during rehab.

## Conclusion

Our visualizations turn complex recovery metrics into a story that patients can instantly grasp. Clinicians can use them to share personalized plots at each visit, flagging dips against peer IQRs, reinforcing readiness gains, and setting realistic goals. Future interactive dashboards with filterable metrics and animated overlays, live sensor and EHR syncing, custom alerts, and predictive forecasts will empower swift data-driven action to keep every recovery on track.
