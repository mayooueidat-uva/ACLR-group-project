## Audience

Our dataset largely consists of patients aged 12 to 20, who represent our primary audience. However, there are a few patients who fall outside this age range. Therefore, our working audience includes all patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction surgery and can benefit from visual tools to understand their recovery. 

## Problem Statement

ACL Reconstruction marks a crucial milestone on the journey back to full activity for our predominantly adolescent and young adult patients (ages 12–20), yet too often they’re handed mountains of clinical jargon and tables of Limb Symmetry Index scores that feel abstract and alienating. Without a way to “see themselves” in the data, seeing their own recovery line rise alongside a cohort of peers, patients risk drifting into uncertainty, losing confidence in their rehab plan, or even disengaging altogether. What we need instead is a set of interactive visualizations that place each individual’s progress front and center against meaningful benchmarks drawn from similar patients, transforming these numbers into a clear, reassuring narrative. By turning technical metrics into intuitive, story‑driven graphics, our goal is to empower patients to recognize their own upward trajectory, understand where they stand relative to others, and make informed decisions with confidence—ultimately replacing anxiety with motivation and ensuring that no one feels lost on their path to recovery.  


## Analysis

Patients have the right to understand their ACLR recovery without barriers that limit their comprehension.

### Line Plot

Having the patient be able to **picture themselves in the data** is important, as we want for them to understand where they stand in recovery without explicitly knowing miniscule details about medical terminology. Sometimes, seeing yourself as a positive sloping line among a similarly trending population is enough to reassure that recovery is on track.

With a line plot, a patient can easily see their recovery over multiple visits. Additionally, they can compare themselves to others who have also undergone ACLR and would have the ability to understand their progress without needing complex medical or statistics jargon.

Below is a line graph that captures a single patient's recovery progress for Flexion LSI. Additionally, it has Flexion LSI data over visits from all the patients in the study, which acts as a comparison point for the patient. The patient can easily view their individual recovery, alongside the overall recovery trend from other patients.

We can prepare similar graphs for our patients with other variables of interest, shown below.

### KDE Plot

Though the line plot is useful for showcasing an individual patient's progress over time, it is not effective for portraying the distribution of data; therefore, we want to use a kernel density estimate plot stratified by visit number. We excluded visits above 4, as most patients had fewer visits. 

Compared to line plots, the KDEplot is less familiar to our target audience, so our graph includes an explanation of what it is supposed to portray. We hope that our visualization will demonstrate that people are *more likely* to have higher ACL-RSI scores as time passes and reassure patients who fear they will never feel ready to return to sport.

### Boxplot

The box plot allows patients to understand their data compared to different demographics. Each box pictured represents the interquartile range (IQR) of LSI Extension Strength (60°/s) within an age group, while the whiskers show variability and the dots highlight outliers. The visualization reassures patients that some variation is normal and that most people fall within a certain performance band, particularly as they progress in recovery. By stratifying the data by age group, we emphasize that strength recovery can vary with age, which is helpful for setting age-appropriate expectations during rehab.

## Conclusion

Our visualizations turn complex recovery metrics into a story that patients can instantly grasp. Clinicians can use them to share personalized plots at each visit, flagging dips against peer IQRs, reinforcing readiness gains, and setting realistic goals. Future interactive dashboards with filterable metrics and animated overlays, live sensor and EHR syncing, custom alerts, and predictive forecasts will empower swift data-driven action to keep every recovery on track.
