## Audience

Our dataset largely consists of patients aged 12 to 20, who represent our primary audience. However, there are a few patients who fall outside this age range. Therefore, our working audience includes all patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction surgery and can benefit from visual tools to understand their recovery. 

## Problem Statement

ACL Reconstruction marks a crucial milestone on the journey back to full activity for our predominantly adolescent and young adult patients (ages 12–20), yet too often they’re handed mountains of clinical jargon and tables of Limb Symmetry Index scores that feel abstract and alienating. Without a way to “see themselves” in the data, seeing their own recovery line rise alongside a cohort of peers, patients risk drifting into uncertainty, losing confidence in their rehab plan, or even disengaging altogether. What we need instead is a set of interactive visualizations that place each individual’s progress front and center against meaningful benchmarks drawn from similar patients, transforming these numbers into a clear, reassuring narrative. By turning technical metrics into intuitive, story‑driven graphics, our goal is to empower patients to recognize their own upward trajectory, understand where they stand relative to others, and make informed decisions with confidence—ultimately replacing anxiety with motivation and ensuring that no one feels lost on their path to recovery.  


## Analysis

Patients have the right to understand their ACLR recovery without barriers that limit their comprehension.

Having the patient be able to **picture themselves in the data** is important, as we want for them to understand where they stand in recovery without explicitly knowing miniscule details about medical terminology. Sometimes, seeing yourself as a positive sloping line among a similarly trending population is enough to reassure that recovery is on track.

Through a line plot, a patient can visually see progression over multiple visits, allowing them to notice any irregularities that go against the general pattern, which is usually an increase in the recovery statistic. Additionally, having a background population of patients who also underwent ACL surgery acts as a comparison point, allowing a patient to compare themselves to a group of people who have gone through a similar recovery process.

This is a line graph that captures a single patient's recovery progress for Flexion LSI. Additionally, it has Flexion LSI data over visits from all the patients in the study, which acts as a comparison point for the patient. The patient can easily view their individual recovery, alongside the overall recovery trend from other patients.

This line graph can be easily modified to show other recovery variables. This plot below is a continuation of the first line plot, and visualizes three Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) assessments for patient 109.
