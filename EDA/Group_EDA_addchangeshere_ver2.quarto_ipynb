        "\n",
        "Young athletes who have undergone ACLR may find it difficult to interpret their recovery and performance data, especially when presented with technical terms. How can we educate young athletes about their recovery progress and expectations of athletic performance based on patients similar to them?\n",

        "\n",
        "#### acl_rsi\n",
        "* Anterior cruciate ligament return-to-sport after injury survey. Patients are given a survey (the “ACL-RSI” survey) where they answer questions related to “appraisal,” “confidence,” and “emotions,” and their psychological readiness score is calculated out of one hundred points. Though our report largely focuses on athletes’ performance after ACLR, psychological readiness remains relevant because suffering an athletic injury and undergoing surgery will affect a person beyond the physical dimension of their sport. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### lsi_ext_isok_60\n",
        "* Limb symmetry index (abbreviated as “`lsi`” in our variable names) for isokinetic (“`isok`”) extension strength (“`ext`”) at a sixty-degree angle (“`60`”). We choose to include `lsi_ext_isok_60` as an objective measure of athletes’ strength post-ACLR (which would relate to athletic performance).\n",
        "  * Isokinetic strength is measured in torque. \n",
        "  * Limb symmetry index is a percentage value calculated by measuring the torque of the involved (i.e. affected) limb, measuring the torque of the contralateral limb, dividing the involved limb value by the contralateral limb value, and multiplying by one hundred. \n",
        "  * The patient bends their leg backwards sixty degrees for isokinetic strength measurements. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### lsi_flex_isok_60\n",
        "* Limb symmetry index (“`lsi`”) for isokinetic (“`isok`”) flexion strength (“`flex`”) at a sixty-degree angle (“`60`”). The patient bends their leg forward sixty degrees (i.e. back its original position) for isokinetic strength measurements, but limb symmetry index is calculated the same way. We include `lsi_flex_isok_60` in our report for the same purpose as `lsi_ext_isok_60`. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### sh_lsi\n",
        "* \"Single hop\" (\"`sh`\") limb symmetry index (\"`lsi`\"). Included in our dataset because it measures patients’ abilities while they are engaged in movements similar to when they play sports.\n",
        "  * a patient hopped once on their afflicted limb, then they hopped once on the contralateral limb. \n",
        "  * The hop distances were taken in metres, and the involved limb value was divided by the contralateral limb value and multiplied by one hundred. \n",
        "\n",
        "Notably, our dataset did not contain a control group that did not undergo ACLR, so we cannot assess the benefits of the procedure from our data alone. \n",
